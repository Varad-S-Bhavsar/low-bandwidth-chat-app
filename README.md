## 🚀 Why I Built This

As a software developer passionate about real-world problem solving, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to:
- Build scalable full-stack applications
- Optimize performance for poor network conditions
- Implement real-time WebSocket communication
- Design responsive and clean UI without relying on heavy libraries

> This project proves my understanding of full-stack development, performance optimization, real-time systems, and user-focused design — all crucial for SDE roles.
